I am a Ph.D. student at the [NLP Lab](https://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/NLP_lab.html){:target="\_blank"} of the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Olga Vechtomova](https://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/){:target="\_blank"}.
My research focuses on multimodal deep learning and generative text modelling, where I explore ways to extract visual and auditory cues to generate better text.
I am also interested in learning the dynamics of the shared multimodal latent space.

I am also a Visiting Researcher at ServiceNow Research, collaborating with
the Human-Machine Interaction Through Language (HMITL) and the Low Data Learning (LDL) groups.

I earned a thesis-based M.Math. degree in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.
Prior to that, I got my B.Tech. degree in Manufacturing Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur)](http://iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Prof. Pawan Goyal](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/){:target="\_blank"} on Program Synthesis for Natural Language.

Apart from research, I am much enthused by language and art.
I love to sometimes engross myself with sketching and painting.
Check out [my art collection](https://photos.app.goo.gl/no5gipGp9HGyZrR28){:target="\_blank"} if you'd like!
I have been learning to play the piano and to speak Japanese and French.

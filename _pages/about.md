I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Information Systems Group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/) at [the University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Dimka Karastoyanova](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/Main/DimkaKarastoyanova) and [Dr. Fatih Turkmen](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/Main/FatihTurkmen)

In my research, I utilize Blockchain and smart contracts for secure and privacy-preserving data exchange and analysis. Specifically, I develop decentralized methods for sharing and analysis of genomic data with the aim to improve existing frameworks that aim to support genomic data sharing and encourage collaborations. 

Next to research, I was a teaching assistance in advanced topics in security and privacy to MSc. (Computer Science) students. The teaching material and outcome can be found under teaching tab.

Outside of work, I enjoy drinking coffee, and riding my bike around Groningen.
